# My SQL Academy Problem Solutions

I started with basic SQL problems to familiarize myself with common database tasks. Through these exercises, I gained a clear understanding of SQL's core functionality: storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in relational databases, even at massive scales.

## Key Problem Types I Encountered:
Data retrieval: Finding specific individuals by name or characteristics

Event analysis: Tracking event attendance and participant statistics

Multi-table operations: Querying related datasets through table joins

## Technical Observations:
1. SQL excels at handling structured data across tables with defined relationships

2. The language provides powerful tools for:

- Filtering records with WHERE clauses

- Aggregating data using GROUP BY and aggregate functions

- Combining datasets via various JOIN operations

3. Even simple queries can surface meaningful insights from complex databases

These exercises demonstrated how SQL transforms raw data into actionable information through logical operations. I've included both my initial solutions and optimized versions where applicable.
